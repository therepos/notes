### Objectives:

At the end of this episode, I will be able to understand:

1. IS operations should focus on delivering value through services and products
2. Service level management takes the behind the scenes processes and ensures that they ultimately meet business based service level targets
3. Service level agreements (SLAs) are built upon service level targets
4. Defined levels should be regularly checked against strategic objectives.
